[This is a great article](http://dataaspirant.com/2015/04/11/five-most-popular-similarity-measures-implementation-in-python/) on some popular distance metrics.  In this notebook, we will be looking specifically at two of these measures.  \n",

Measures that are closer to 0 imply that two vectors are more similar to one another.  The larger these values become, the more dissimilar two vectors are to one another.\n",
